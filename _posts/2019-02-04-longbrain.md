### Overview

For many years I ate whatever I wanted, mostly on impulse. Over time I noticed patterns: some foods left me fatigued, with brain fog, and/or feeling erratic while others did not. This made me wonder, if some foods can negatively impact my cognition to that degree, then can others reliably *improve* it?

After trying the butter coffee at [Picnik](https://picnikaustin.com/blogs/journal/butter-coffee) I was impressed by its flavor and nutrition profile. I decided to innovate on butter coffee recipes by adding protein and a few well-supported cognitive enhancers.

Specifically, I wanted a beverage with the following properties:

* Optimized for improved cognition
* Minimal negative side-effects, even with daily consumption
* Macro profile: High-fat, medium-protein, low-carb
* Meal replacement / supplement
* Tastes good with absolutely no sweeteners
* Personally vetted, highest quality ingredients

The recipe below is the result of several iterations and adjustments. I liked it so much I decided to name it 'LongBrain' after the effects I observed: sustained mental clarity and energy for several hours. It also tastes really good. At the time of publishing this article I have prepared it three+ days a week for several months with no noticeable negative side-effects

### Ingredient Selection

* Coffee contains caffeine which stimulates cognitive function. The strong flavor is also a good base flavor which overrides bitterness from the other ingredients
* Ghee (or Butter) is a good source of fat. Fats are the primary source of energy on a ketogenic diet. Fats also reduce the acidic flavor of the coffee
* MCT Oil is a type of fat which is easily processed by the liver (into ketones), yielding energy faster than ghee and butter
* Whey (protein, muscle maintenance and growth)
* Collagen (protein, joint maintenance)
* Creatine (improve cognitive function and workouts)
* L-theanine
* Unsweetened Cocoa Powder (flavanol)
  * Cocoa flavanol contains epicatechin + catechin which are anti-inflammatory and lower LDL cholesterol [[*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jch.12715)]

### Brand Selection

I personally use each brand below when making LongBrain. I do not make any money from referral links and will not take any form of compensation to promote a product. I buy most of the below ingredients on Amazon as they usually have the best prices

* Organic Coffee: I appreciate high-quality coffee and have had great experiences with [Huck](https://huckleberryroasters.com/), [Amaya](https://www.amayaroasting.com/) and [Boomtown](https://www.boomtowncoffee.com/) roasters. That said, a lot of the nuance in flavor is lost (when combined with other ingredients) so I also routinely use an organic Columbian blend from my local grocer
* Organic Ghee or Butter: [OMGhee](https://omghee.com/) and [Ancient Organics](https://www.ancientorganics.com/) are both really good. OMGhee tastes a little better but orders typically have a wait-time
* MCT Oil: [Sports Research MCT](https://sportsresearch.com/products/premium-mct-oil-32oz). This is cheap and entry level given its mix of MCTs (C8 and C10). I'll be testing a few pure C8 products soon (the ones listed [here](https://ketosource.co/caprylic-acid-c8/)). MCT stands for medium-chain triglycerides and is not an exact description of a product. [Evidence](https://ketosource.co/caprylic-acid-c8/) suggests caprylic acid (C8) is preferable over other types of MCT. This can be verified on the nutrition label
* Unflavored Whey Isolate: [Now Foods](https://www.nowfoods.com/sports-nutrition/whey-protein-isolate-unflavored-powder)
  * [Scores highly](https://labdoor.com/rankings/protein) on [LabDoor](https://labdoor.com/about)
* Unflavored Collagen Peptides: [Further Foods](https://shop.furtherfood.com/products/collagen-peptides-protein-powder)
* Creatine Monohydrate: [Bulk Supplements](https://www.bulksupplements.com/creatine-monohydrate.html)
  - [Scores very highly](https://labdoor.com/rankings/creatine) on [LabDoor](https://labdoor.com/about)
* L-theanine: [Bulk Supplements](https://www.bulksupplements.com/l-theanine.html)
* Organic, Unsweetened Cocoa Powder: [Pure Natural Miracles](https://www.purenaturalmiracles.com/products/pure-natural-miracles-cacao-powder-raw-and-organic)
  * Much of the cocoa / chocolate available for purchase at retailers is alkalized using the Dutch Method.  The Dutch Method drastically reduces the presence of flavanols [[*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18710243)].  Do not buy Cocoa made using the _Dutch Method_. Unprocessed cocoa is the best source
  * According to the manufacturer (Pure Natural Miracles): "This raw cacao powder is stone ground and unprocessed and contains no added sugars, retaining its full bodied nutrition profile"

### Recipe

![ingredients](/assets/longbrain/all-the-ingredients-min.jpg)

1 Serving:

* 12 to 14 ounces of hot coffee
* 1 tablespoon of ghee or butter
* 1 tablespoon of MCT
* 1 scoop/serving (28g) of whey
* 1 scoop/serving (8g) of collagen
* 1 teaspoon of creatine
* 1/8th teaspoon of L-theanine
* 1 tablespoon cocoa powder

### Instructions

![ready-to-go](/assets/longbrain/ready-to-go-min.jpg)

1. Put ghee/butter, MCT, creatine, and L-theanine into a coffee pot, then make coffee. In the photo I'm using a pour-over method of making coffee but any method is fine
2. While the coffee is brewing, scoop the whey, collagen, and cocoa powder into a cup
3. This last step is the hard part. Use an immersion blender to mix in the protein and cocoa. Ensure the protein mixes into the coffee as quickly as possible. If mixed too slowly, the protein will cook and leave *particulates* in the coffee. This happened to me the first few times until I got the technique down.
   * See the gif below for my technique. In this coffee pot the key is to hold the immersion blender off-center and pour into the center
