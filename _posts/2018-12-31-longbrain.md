**Experiments**

* \#1 'LongBrain'
  * Ingredients
    * Coffee (caffeine)
    * L-theanine
    * MCT Oil (high-fat, 100% Coconut-based)
      * medium-chain triglycerides, processed directly in the liver to produce ketones. Take time to process compared to exogenous ketones
    * Exogenous Ketones (faster acting than MCT)? Probably not.  Best source appears to be Ketone Salts which may interfere with the taste.  Could add these to a separate bone broth
    * Ghee (butter with milk solids removed)
    * Protein (Whey, hemp protein tastes bad)
    * CBD?
  * Notes
    * Eating carbs will cancel some of the effects of this mix.  These fats are optimally processed when carbs are not present in the body
