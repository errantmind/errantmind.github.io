- There are a couple of important pitfalls worth mentioning. First, eating carbohydrates before or after drinking LongBrain will limit the beneficial effects:
  - The brain operates on two main energy sources: glucose and beta-hydroxybutyrate (a major ketone derived from fat). When 
  - Insulin spikes from carbohydrates cause brain-fog
